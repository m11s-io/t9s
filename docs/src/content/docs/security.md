description: Protect Talos credentials while using the read-only interface.
---

The current t9s UI is read-only. It offers no mutation operation and no arbitrary command path.

The supplied Talos credentials can still be privileged. Protect every talosconfig as a sensitive secret and grant only the permissions an operator needs.

- Never commit a real talosconfig, certificate, private key, token, endpoint, or internal hostname.
- Prefer narrowly scoped Talos roles where the cluster policy allows them.
- Keep configuration files readable only by the intended local user.
- Use invented identities, reserved addresses, and fake credentials in tests and examples.

Report security issues through the private security-reporting channel configured on the GitHub repository rather than a public issue.
